    longDescription: >
      This project provides everything you need to run CKAN plus a set of 
      extensions for supporting Italian open data. You can run the full stack
      using docker-compose to orchestrate four containers providing CKAN 2.6.8, Solr 6.2,
      Redis 5.0.5, PostgreSQL 10.1.
      
      "Warning: this product is under active development and it is to be considered unstable."
      It has been currently used only in testing environments,
      but we think it can provide a good base for running a production service
      (please feel free to contribute with pull requests to this end).
